A: The engine is rated at 95% accuracy for\\nstandard neat handwriting. For \\\"messy\\\" or cursive writing, the AI utilizes contextual prediction. If you write a messy word\\nin a sentence about \\\"finance,\\\" it is more likely to interpret a squiggle as \\\"budget\\\" rather than \\\"badger.\\\" It improves\\nsignificantly after 1-2 weeks of usage as it builds a profile of your style.  \\nQ: Can I edit the text after it has been converted? A: Yes. Once converted, the text block can be edited using an on-\\nscreen keyboard, or you can export it to a computer for final polishing.  \\nQ: Does the device emit blue light? A: No. The E-Ink display is front-lit, not back-lit, meaning light is cast onto the\\npage, not into your eyes. You can adjust the \\\"warmth\\\" of the light (from cool white to amber) to match your circadian\\nrhythm.  \\n#### Hardware & Accessories  \\nQ: How durable is the stylus tips? A: The stylus tips are made of a durable felt-composite to mimic the feel of a pencil.\\nA standard tip lasts 3-6 months depending on writing pressure. The package includes 5 replacement tips and a removal\\ntool.  \\nQ: Is the device water-resistant? A: The SmartScribble is splash-resistant (IP52 rated), meaning it can handle light rain\\nor a minor spill, but it should not be submerged.  \\n#### Software & Subscription  \\nQ: Is there a monthly fee for the AI features? A: The basic handwriting recognition and cloud sync are free forever.\\nThe \\\"Advanced AI Expansion\\\" (generative brainstorming) is free for the first year. After that, it is a strictly optional\\nsubscription of $4.99/month to cover cloud computing costs.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nQ: How secure is my data? A: Security is paramount. All notes are encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).\\nUsers can also password-protect specific folders or the entire device.  \\n#### Support & Warranty  \\nQ: What happens if I break the screen? A: E-Ink screens are delicate. We offer a standard 1-year manufacturer\\nwarranty covering defects. We highly recommend purchasing our \\\"ScribbleCare+\\\" protection plan ($49), which covers\\naccidental damage, including screen drops, for two years.  \\nQ: What is the return policy? A: We are confident you will love the SmartScribble. If you are not satisfied, you may\\nreturn the device in its original packaging within 30 days of receipt for a full refund, minus return shipping costs.  \\n#### Section 9: What's in the Box?  \\n1\\\\.

Your Ideas, Amplified.\", \"This is the flagship feature that separates SmartScribble from every other E-Ink tablet on the market. By connecting to\\nthe Cloud Nexus, users can interact with a Generative AI specifically tuned for ideation.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n\\u00b7 The \\\"Expand\\\" Command: Circle a keyword (e.g., \\\"Marketing Strategy\\\") and select \\\"Expand.\\\" The Al will\\ngenerate a sub-list of bullet points (e.g., \\\"Social Media Channels,\\\" \\\"Budget Allocation,\\\" \\\"Influencer Outreach\\\")\\ndirectly onto the page in a distinct digital font.  \\n\\u00b7 Writer's Block Breaker: Stuck on a sentence? Draw a question mark in the margin, and the Al will offer context-\\naware prompts or continuations based on the previous paragraphs.  \\n\\u00b7 Summarization: Highlight several pages of notes and ask the Al to \\\"Generate Summary.\\\" It will create a concise\\nbulleted list of key takeaways on a new page. The \\\"Smart\\\" in SmartScribble is driven by our dual-layer AI architecture: Local Core (for privacy and speed) and Cloud\\nNexus (for power). #### Functionality & Usage  \\nQ: How accurate is the handwriting recognition on messy writing? A: The engine is rated at 95% accuracy for\\nstandard neat handwriting. For \\\"messy\\\" or cursive writing, the AI utilizes contextual prediction. If you write a messy word\\nin a sentence about \\\"finance,\\\" it is more likely to interpret a squiggle as \\\"budget\\\" rather than \\\"badger.\\\" It improves\\nsignificantly after 1-2 weeks of usage as it builds a profile of your style.  \\nQ: Can I edit the text after it has been converted? A: Yes. Once converted, the text block can be edited using an on-\\nscreen keyboard, or you can export it to a computer for final polishing.  \\nQ: Does the device emit blue light? A: No. The E-Ink display is front-lit, not back-lit, meaning light is cast onto the\\npage, not into your eyes. You can adjust the \\\"warmth\\\" of the light (from cool white to amber) to match your circadian\\nrhythm.  \\n#### Hardware & Accessories  \\nQ: How durable is the stylus tips? A: The stylus tips are made of a durable felt-composite to mimic the feel of a pencil.\\nA standard tip lasts 3-6 months depending on writing pressure. The package includes 5 replacement tips and a removal\\ntool.  \\nQ: Is the device water-resistant? A: The SmartScribble is splash-resistant (IP52 rated), meaning it can handle light rain\\nor a minor spill, but it should not be submerged.  \\n#### Software & Subscription  \\nQ: Is there a monthly fee for the AI features? A: The basic handwriting recognition and cloud sync are free forever.\\nThe \\\"Advanced AI Expansion\\\" (generative brainstorming) is free for the first year. After that, it is a strictly optional\\nsubscription of $4.99/month to cover cloud computing costs.  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nQ: How secure is my data? A: Security is paramount.
